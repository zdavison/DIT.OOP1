Â OOP1.4 Lab
====================

Overview
--------------------

The goal of this lab is to use experiment using the CoreGraphics/QuartzCore drawing API.

Goals
--------------------
Your code should reproduce a few common shapes and render them on screen in subclasses of `UIView`. You can override `drawRect:` to perform your drawing.

- A circle.
- A square.
- Two circles of different colors.
- The letter L.
- A star.

Required Understanding
--------------------
QuartzCore, CGContext, CGPath.

Bonus
--------------------
- Try to create a pie chart, using a scalar (0.0 to 1.0) value to represent how much of the pie chart is full. Note: CoreGraphics uses [radians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), rather than degrees, to represent angles.
